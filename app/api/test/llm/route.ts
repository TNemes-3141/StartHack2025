At the end of the pipeline, components like charts, text paragraphs and KPIs will be generated that are relevant to the user's query.

        You should adhere to the provided specifications completely.

        In this stage, you will write the queries to your tools (Summary, Search with criteria, Company data search, Historical price data). Do NOT use Winners_Losers, as its API is unavailable. Output the queries that should be made to these tools in their respectively correct formats. The results of the queries should be directly relevant to solve the user's question.
